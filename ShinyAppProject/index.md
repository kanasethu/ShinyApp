## Read-And-Delete

As part of the Coursera Data Products course I created a simple app to browse the prices of recently sold condos (2010-2015) in the Camrbridge MA area.

Data for this app was downloaded from: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Assessing/Residential-Data-Report-FY2016

## Slide 2

* When the app is launched for the first time, it shows a histogram of sale prices for a given price range sliced by the year.
* The price range can be modified using the double-ended slider.
* Hitting the "Go!" button displays a table of addresses and sale prices for the top 10 costliest homes in the selected range.
